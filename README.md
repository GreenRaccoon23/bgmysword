Program to generate MySword Bible modules by looking up non-copyrighted Bibles on biblegateway.com.  
(Written in Go/Golang)

2. Download the `.msi` file (e.g. `go1.4.1.windows-amd64.msi`).
3. Double-click the `.msi` to install Go.
  
###Ubuntu###
1. Run `sudo apt-get install golang`

###Arch Linux###
1. Run `sudo pacman -S go`

##Instructions to Install Dependencies##
